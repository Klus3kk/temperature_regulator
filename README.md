# Temperature Regulator of an Incubator

This project simulates a temperature regulation system for an incubator. The control system dynamically adjusts the heater's power using a PI controller, visualizing temperature changes. Users can manipulate the control signal via a slider, and the simulation displays historical data on a Plotly graph.
