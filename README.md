# temperature_regulator
This project simulates a temperature regulation system for an incubator. The control system dynamically adjusts the heater's power using a proportional-integral (PI) controller, visualizing temperature changes in real time. Users can manipulate the control signal via a slider, and the simulation displays historical data on a dynamic Plotly graph.
